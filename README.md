# echo-server
Echo server in GO for protobuffers implementation. It just prints though console what's being received. In this case it's being using a specific proto file for events.

### To deploy locally in your machine: 

Install GO: https://go.dev/doc/install

#### To install protobuffer compiler. If you are using another platform please go here: https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/
```
brew install protobuf
```

#### To install Go dependencies: 
```
go install http://google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.28
go install http://google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.2
```

Project has a Makefile but is not yet working completely: 

#### To generate protobufers (not needed if there are no new changes)
```
make gen-protobuf
```

>Note if the previous command fail might be due to not having environment variables not properly defined. Please refer to this guide: ?>https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/ but basically you can run this: 

```
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```
#### To build 
```
make build-osx 
```

#### To run the server locally
```
make run-server
```

#### For cleaning build folder
```
make clean
```
